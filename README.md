I'm using React-Router-DOM as well as axios in tandem with fakestoreapi to build a comprehensive shopping page with a shopping cart. The goal is to have a home page with a bunch of different routes, but my shopping page will also have a route to each individual item.

And now I am also using redux to provide a global state! which makes nested routing a bit easier as well as the contents of the shopping cart a bit more easy to access, i believe it provides some scalability for myself :)

I believe there are some typos on my page, those are associated with the fakestoreapi that i'm using - so don't look too harshly on them!
